##### Q1. Did this tribe get evaluated correctly ? Qualify your Yes/No with reasons.

##### Q2. What are the best things (point wise) you observed in this Tribe's report ? These are points you will incorporate in your next Report.
- Great explaining each readablity index.
- Good job incorporating the Critical path for the project.
- Giffy explaination is good since it gives you a simple model of the system.
- Great design section, includes all major FOV and model renders are very good as well. Plan for the house is also very appropriately done.
- Great Job in Appendix section.

##### Q3. What are the worst things (point wise) you observed in this Tribe's report ? These are points you will avoid in your next report.
- Table of contents not made very properly.
- Gantt Chart could have been improved.
- Data in the requirements needs to be more generalised by using tables instead of paragraphs which are harder to read and understand.
- Links could have been added properly in the pdf file where mentioning the whole URL can be avoided.
- Specifications for no reason include so much explainations about the working and composition for each material. These could have been easily avoided and a seperate section to explain the process and calculations from there can be incorporated in specifications.
- Cannot comprehend what was the need to mention the whole warranty specification for each product here even when most products of similar specifications will have similar warranty and a link to the warranty could have been included saving extra reading time for the reader.
- Bill of materials not done in a proper way i.e. similar to bill reciepts.
