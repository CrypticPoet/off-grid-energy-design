## Wires
### Solar DC Cable
DC Solar Panel cables are required to connect the array of solar panels in series with each other and then carry the output DC Current to the Solar Charge Controller.

When choosing DC Solar Panel wires, some things should be kept in mind
- The wires should be of sufficient diameter to ensure that no overheating occurs
- The wires should be of adequate current rating
- UV resistance to ensure longevity
