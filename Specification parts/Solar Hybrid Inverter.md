### Solar Charge Controller

Charge controllers are used to control the amount of current fed into the battery by the solar panels. This ensures the batteries are not overcharged during the day and don't leak current back to the panels during the night. So, Solar Charge Controller must be compatible with solar panel and the battery bank. Our Hybrid inverter comes built in with an MPPT Charge controller which is more efficient at DC Conversion compared to older PWM technology.

#### Sizing
Sizing of a controller depends on three factors
- Solar panel array’s maximum open-circuit voltage (Voc)
- Total Power rating of Solar panel array
- Battery Bank Voltage
