### Solar Panel Mounts

Panel mounts are used to fix solar panels on surfaces like roofs, building facades, or ground. The panel array is mounted with each panel aligned at an angle. This angle is variable and mounts should be bought according to the type of rooftop. We'll be using ones with 25° inclination.

We'll be using 2 such mounts for our system, which consists of 8 panels.
