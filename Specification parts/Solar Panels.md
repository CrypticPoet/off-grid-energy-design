### High Efficiency Solar Panels

Solar panels collect clean renewable energy in the form of sunlight and convert that light into electricity which can then be used to provide power for electrical loads. 

The panels which we're using, are based on [mono PERC cells](https://regenpower.com/news/why-choose-mono-perc-panels-rooftop-solar/), which results into higher electricity generation due to higher light absorption per unit area, when compared to traditional panels.
 
It also paves the way for more power output per panel, which means less number of panels are required for a given power requirement. It means less expenditure for

We'll be using 8 such panels in our system.
