### Backup Generator

The generator size should be of 1kW. In our system, generator will mostly be needed during winter when there is a lack of solar energy production. Since this is a backup system the below power consumed is assumed to be calculated under minimal load when running backup generator.

Total Instantaneous Power Consumed = 0.020*2(light)+0.5(misc) = 0.58kW

**Note**: Here the misc includes PC,stove and other appliances that we might/might not use under emergency situation. The generator should be able to run under the above conditions for 9hr(which is minimum requirement for overnight functionality). Spare fuel should always be kept in case of emergencies.
