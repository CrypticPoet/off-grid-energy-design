### Backup Generator

The generator size should be of 3kW. In our system, generator will mostly be needed during winter when there is a lack of solar energy production. So the power calculation will be done under winter conditions. And since this is a backup system the below power consumed is assumed to be calculated under maximum load when running backup generator.

Total Instantaneous Power Consumed = 0.036*4(light)+1.5(house heater)+0.15(fridge)+1(misc.) = 2.8kW

**Note**: Here the misc. includes TV,PC, and other appliances that we might/might not use under emergency situation. The generator should be able to run under the above conditions for 12hr. Spare fuel should always be kept in case of emergencies.
