## SCOPE

In this hustling daily routine, many people tend to resort to a house in the forest for peace of mind. Also, there is a large part of India where electricity has not reached yet. This is an off-grid solution for daily energy needs such as electricity and heat energy. 

We will be using solar panels for electricity along with a diesel/petrol generator for backup in order to meet the electricity needs. A biogas plant for heat energy needs will also be used as a backup.

We will be covering the technical aspects of the components involved such as the electrical specifications of all components needed for a fully functional solar power setup, power output of fuel generator. We will also cover the physical/mechanical specifications such as dimensions etc. Apart from this, it also includes supplier information, 3D Diagrams of setup/assembly and cost analysis such as price of components along with installation charges.

The solution has been made keeping in mind a specific geographical location (A forest in eastern coast of India) which has ample fuel wood, natural water sources nearby, sufficient amount of biomass (twigs, leaves fallen on ground) nearby for utilizing in biogas plant. It is designed assuming the energy needs of a family of 6 members. It will not be an optimal solution if the family has more than 6 members or there is a greater number of adults in the family than assumed. (Average energy needs of an adult are more than that of kids). Energy requirements for appliances such as television, refrigerator, air-conditioner etc. are not included in the analysis as these will be considered as “luxury items” considering the location to be an isolated forest. The supplier information and component availability is mentioned keeping India in mind. Hence the components might not be available outside India. It has provisions if there is lack of proper sunlight for a few days, but prolonged periods of improper sunlight will lead to relying on fuel generator for energy demands. It has been assumed that there will not be any kind of hinderance in the path of sunlight incident on solar panels.
