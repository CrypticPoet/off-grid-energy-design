# Feedback Tribe A
##### Q1. Did this tribe get evaluated correctly ? Qualify your Yes/No with reasons.
This Tribe will be evaluated to 7 marks of 15. Majorly their marks are cut at a messy and highly inefficient organisation of the details and not creating distinct boundaries of design, specifications, requirements etc.

##### Q2. What are the best things (point wise) you observed in this Tribe's report ? These are points you will incorporate in your next Report.
- Uniform structure of the report throughout.
- Only relevant figures, well placed throughout the report. Good job on the CAD diagrams. 
- Well. Documented report with a clean and concise presentation.
- Tables and lists are very neat.
- Appendix work is also done greatly, properly documenting each week's progress and work through Gantt charts.

##### Q3. What are the worst things (point wise) you observed in this Tribe's report ? These are points you will avoid in your next report.
-  There should be a ':' instead of ',' in 'ELP 305, Design Systems Laboratory'
- The sections of table of contents are linked but the subsections are not linked
- There is no 'Back to table of contents' link after every section in the document.
- The headers of coulmns in the tables are not bold. Eg: In section 3.1 'Abbreviations' and 'Definitions' are not in **bold
- The information in List of Tables in section 3.3 are not linked to the actual tables
- The information in List of Figures in section 3.4 are not linked to the actual figures
- The Gantt chart is not linked to Section 3.5
- Font size is a bit small
- In Section 9.2.5 the common element like nitrogen could have been one big single row instead of repeating it multiple times
- Sub-headings like 'Design specifications for the Compost Tumbler are as follows' in Section 9.2.5 are not bold
- Many figures used are colored
-Section 11 is empty
- The figure names (Eg:- Figure 22:Working schematics of the Wind Mill) are not bold.
- Cannot comprehend why the Design part contains specifications and requirements as well as why it contains the troubleshooting of situations e.g in case of Battery storage room.

##### Q4. Please make some good appreciative / encouraging / positive comments about the effort made by this Tribe in putting together their report. Organize your comments on the rubric of sub-efforts â€“ documentation, technical content, team work, tool usage, readability, usability for a possible product offering.
Documentation, technical content, team work and tool usage are good, but the readablity and usability of the report is miserable. Overall it was a very neat documented report and readablity can be easily improved if the guidelines are followed properly. Good stuff!
