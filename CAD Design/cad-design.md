***Label 1*** - Solar Panels  
Solar panels to take the solar energy and give a DC current.

***Label 2*** - Inverter  
Takes the solar DC current and supply it power supply as well as store it in battery.

***Label 3*** - Battery  
Stores the solar converted electrical energy for further use when solar power cannot be harnessed e.g. Night.
