## 3.2 Wiring Diagram
The next step is to realize the design using all the components mentioned in the specifications by appropriately connecting them. The diagram below shows the connections for the same.

The solar panels are connected in a 2x2 fashion using the MC4 Panel Connectors. These are then connected to a DC Circuit Breaker using T4 connectors. The wires then go via a DC Surge Protector to the invertor which is connected to a series combination of 3 batteries of 12V each. The output of the invertor then goes to an AC circuit breaker which has also been connected to the generator for backup. This is finally connected to the MCB inside the house.
